# CS585-Natural-Language-Processing
In this repo I am going to explore various process of NLP in preprocessing data, basic analysis and train the models for tasks like QnA, Next Word Predictions etc. 

For the Dataset, I will be variety of opensource dataset available, but mainly I will try to use the dataset of classroom transcribe of my class, I am very thankful of Prof. Jacek Dzikowski who gave me permission to use the transcribe for this task.
